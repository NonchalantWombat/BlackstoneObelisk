A journal purportedly written long ago by the wizard Lum describes strange, cylindrical chambers of metal buried in the ground from which froghemoths emerged, but no reliable reports of the location of such places exist.</p><p>Every few years, a froghemoth can lay a fertile egg without mating. The froghemoth cares nothing for its egg and might eat the hatchling. A young froghemoth's survival thus depends on its parent leaving it behind in indifference. A newborn froghemoth grows to full size over a period of months by indiscriminately preying on other creatures in its swampy domain. It learns to hide its enormous body in murky pools, keeping only its eyestalk above water to watch for passing creatures. When food comes within reach, the froghemoth erupts from its pool, tentacles and tongue flailing. It can grab several targets at once; it wraps its tongue around one and pulls it in to be devoured while holding the rest at bay.</p><p>If @creature[bullywug||bullywugs] come across a froghemoth, the bullywugs may treat the froghemoth as a god and do all they can to coax the monster into their den. A froghemoth can be tamed (after a fashion) by offering it food, and bullywugs can communicate with it on a basic level, so the creature might eat only a few bullywugs before following the rest. The bullywugs gather food as tribute for it, provide it with a comfortable lair, protect it from harm, and try to ensure that any of its offspring reach

This energy motivates a skeleton to move and think in a rudimentary fashion, though only as a pale imitation of the way it behaved in life. An animated skeleton retains no connection to its past, although resurrecting a skeleton restores it body and soul, banishing the hateful undead spirit that empowers it.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>While most skeletons are the animated remains of dead humans and other humanoids, skeletal undead can be created from the bones of other creatures besides humanoids, giving rise to a host of terrifying and unique forms.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"2722\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Obedient Servants.</span></span> <p>Skeletons raised by spell are bound to the will of their creator. They follow orders to the letter, never questioning the tasks their masters give them, regardless of the consequences. Because of their literal interpretation of commands and unwavering obedience, skeletons adapt poorly to changing circumstances. They can't read, speak, emote, or communicate in any way except to nod, shake their heads, or point. Still, skeletons are able to accomplish a variety of relatively complex tasks.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>A skeleton can fight with weapons and wear armor, can load and fire a catapult or trebuchet, scale a siege ladder, form a shield wall, or dump boiling oil. However, it must receive careful instructions explaining how such tasks are accomplished.</p><p>Although they lack the intellect they possessed in life, skeletons aren't mindless. Rather than break its limbs attempting to batter its way through an iron door, a skeleton tries the handle first. If that doesn't work, it searches for another way through or around the obstacle.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"2723\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Habitual Behaviors.</span></span> <p>Independent skeletons temporarily or permanently free of a master's control sometimes pantomime actions from their past lives, their bones echoing the rote behaviors of their former living selves. The skeleton of a miner might lift a pick and start chipping away at stone walls. The skeleton of a guard might strike up a post at a random doorway. The skeleton of a dragon might lie down on a pile of treasure, while the skeleton of a horse crops grass it can't eat. Left alone in a ballroom, the skeletons of nobles might continue an eternally unfinished dance.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>When skeletons encounter living creatures, the necromantic energy that drives them compels them to kill unless they are commanded by their masters to refrain from doing so. They attack without mercy and fight until destroyed, for skeletons possess little sense of self and even less sense of self-preservation.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h

The magic animating a zombie imbues it with evil, so left without purpose, it attacks any living creature it encounters.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"3073\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Hideous Forms.</span></span> <p>Zombies appear as they did in life, showing the wounds that killed them. However, the magic that creates these vile creatures often takes time to run its course. Dead warriors might rise from a battlefield, eviscerated and bloated after days in the sun. The muddy cadaver of a peasant could claw its way from the ground, riddled with maggots and worms. A zombie might wash ashore or rise from a marsh, swollen and reeking after weeks in the water.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"3074\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Mindless Soldiers.</span></span> <p>Zombies take the most direct route to any foe, unable to comprehend obstacles, tactics, or dangerous terrain. A zombie might stumble into a fast-flowing river to reach foes on a far shore, clawing at the surface as it is battered against rocks and destroyed. To reach a foe below it, a zombie might step out of an open window. Zombies stumble through roaring infernos, into pools of acid, and across fields littered with caltrops without hesitation.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>A zombie can follow simple orders and distinguish friends from foes, but its ability to reason is limited to shambling in whatever direction it is pointed, pummeling any enemy in its path. A zombie armed with a weapon uses it, but the zombie won't retrieve a dropped weapon or other tool until told to do so.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\"

Wizards that seek lichdom must make bargains with fiends, evil gods, or other foul entities. Many turn to Orcus, Demon Prince of Undeath, whose power has created countless liches. However, those that control the power of lichdom always demand fealty and service for their knowledge.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>A lich is created by an arcane ritual that traps the wizard's soul within a phylactery. Doing so binds the soul to the mortal world, preventing it from traveling to the Outer Planes after death. A phylactery is traditionally an amulet in the shape of a small box, but it can take the form of any item possessing an interior space into which arcane sigils of naming, binding, immortality, and dark magic are scribed in silver.</p><p>With its phylactery prepared, the future lich drinks a potion of transformation-a vile concoction of poison mixed with the blood of a sentient creature whose soul is sacrificed to the phylactery. The wizard falls dead, then rises as a lich as its soul is drawn into the phylactery, where it forever remains.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"1999\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Soul Sacrifices.</span></span> <p>A lich must periodically feed souls to its phylactery to sustain the magic preserving its body and consciousness. It does this using the <a href=\"https://5e.tools/spells.html#imprisonment_phb\">imprisonment</a> spell. Instead of choosing one of the normal options of the spell, the lich uses the spell to magically trap the target's body and soul inside its phylactery. The phylactery must be on the same plane as the lich for the spell to work. A lich's phylactery can hold only one creature at a time, and a dispel magic cast as a 9th-level spell upon the phylactery releases any creature imprisoned within it. A creature imprisoned in the phylactery for 24 hours is consumed and destroyed utterly, whereupon nothing short of divine intervention can restore it to life.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>A lich that fails or forgets to maintain its body with sacrificed souls begins to physically fall apart, and might eventually become a demilich.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"2000\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Death and Restoration.</span></span> <p>When a lich's body is broken by accident or assault, the will and mind of the lich drains from it, leaving only a lifeless corpse behind. Within days, a new body reforms next to the lich's phylactery, coalescing out of glowing smoke that issues from the device. Because the destruction of its phylactery means the possibility of eternal death, a lich usually keeps its phylactery in a hidden, well-guarded location.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>Destroying a lich's phylactery is no easy task and often requires a special ritual, item, or weapon. Every phylactery is unique, and discovering the key to its destruction can be a quest in and of itself.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"2001\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Lonely Existence.</span></span> <p>From time to time, a lich might be stirred from its single-minded pursuit of power to take an interest in the world around it, most often when some great event reminds it of the life it once led. It otherwise lives in isolation, engaging only with those creatures whose service helps secure its lair.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>Few liches call themselves by their former names, instead adopting monikers such as the Black Hand or the Forgotten King.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"2002\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Magic Collectors.</span></span> <p>Liches collect spells and magic items. In addition to its spell repertoire, a lich has ready access to potions, scrolls, libraries of spellbooks, one or more wands, and perhaps a staff or two. It has no qualms about putting these treasures to use whenever its lair comes under attack.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"2003\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Undead Nature.</span></span> <p>A lich doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"2004\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">A Lich's Lair.</span></span> <p>A lich often haunts the abode it favored in life, such as a lonely tower, a haunted ruin, or an academy of black magic. Alternatively, some liches construct secret tombs filled with powerful guardians and traps. Everything about a lich's lair reflects its keen mind and wicked cunning, including the magic and mundane traps that secure it. Undead, constructs, and bound demons lurk in shadowy recesses, emerging to destroy those who dare to disturb the lich's work.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>A lich encountered in its lair has a challenge rating of 22 (41,000 XP).</p></div></div><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"2005\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Lair Actions.</span></span> <p>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the lich can take a lair action to cause one of the following magical effects; the lich can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><ul class=\"rd__list\"><li class=\"rd__li \">The lich rolls a [[/r d8]] and regains a spell slot of that level or lower.

you ever wondered how much an item truly costs? Have you been wanting to find or craft an item but aren’t sure how it fits in to the grand scheme of things? Did you ever look at sovereign glue and say to yourself, “There is no way that glue is worth 500,000 gp when Sentinal shield is worth 500gp”. Well you are in luck because this guide is for you. Brainstorming with the Giant In the Playground, /r/DnDNext, and EnWorld forums, Saidoro has put together a set of tables that break down the costs, reasons for the costs, and DMG page to find the item.</p><h2>DM Preface</h2><p>Your world need not sell the magic items for the prices given below. Your world does not even need to sell the magic items below at all. The primary purpose of the tables below is to establish the relative price of magic items so that you can have a reasonably sane economy and/or so that you can quickly eyeball how much the swag you’re giving your players is worth. You are free to modify the prices as you will, just be sure to tell your players that you are doing so in advance to the game start.</p><p>The items are divided into a few different lists for your convenience. The lists are as follows:</p><ul><li>Consumables are items that are used some set amount of times (usually once) and then are gone.</li><li>Combat Items are items that primarily make the user better at killing things. Some also have other killing-unrelated effects, but these are not the primary source of their utility.</li><li>Noncombat Items are items that primarily make the user better at solving problems in a killingunrelated manner. Some also make the user better at killing things, but this is not the primary source of their utility.</li><li>Summoning Items are items that summon creatures to kill things or solve problems for you.</li><li>Gamechanging Items are items that can have major effects on the way the players engage with the world or that can resculpt the campaign world in some major way all on their own. They are not necessarily overpowered, but the GM should take a look at them to make sure that the items they allow are compatible with the sort of game and world they want to create.</li></ul><p>Each is discussed further in their own section.

sort of things that are capable of challenging their holders. I don’t really see either of these as a problem, but they may not fit with some campaigns or some settings, so the DM should take a careful look at the items on this list and decide whether or not they are allowed.</p><table border=\"1\"><tbody><tr><td><h4><strong>Why Items Are On This List</strong></h4><p>The +X armors and shields, dwarven plate, defender, staff of power and robe of the archmagi all allow the user to boost their AC out of the range of bounded accuracy. Enough AC and a character becomes functionally immune to low level checks on their ability to run rampant, like the town guard or small armies. This sort of thing is possible using items not on this list, but it requires significantly more investment in terms of the player's attunement slots. Characters eventually growing up to the point where they don't care about low level NPCs isn't a bad thing, but it doesn't fit all campaigns.<br /><br />The armor of invulnerability is on this list for about the same reason.<br /><br />All items that grant either flying or a flying mount are on the list for a similar reason, though they obsolete enemies without flying or a strong ranged attack rather than low level nonmagical enemies.<br /><br />The Cloak of invisibility likewise obsoletes enemies that can't see invisible things.<br /><br />The Helm of Teleportation, Amulet of Planes and Cubic Gate are here because they essentially obsolete any quest involving travel times, and in the later cases many quests involving things being on another plane. Additionally, they give an almost absurdly strong panic button to the holder.<br /><br />Sending Stones and the Crystal ball are here because of their impact on the world, both massively change the rate of travel of information, and the latter doubles as an extremely potent knowledge gathering tool in PC hands, which bears looking into for that reason alone.<br /><br />The Alchemy Jug, Decanter of Endless Water, Sphere of Annihilation and Ring of Telekinesis are here for their massive effect on the economy. All three can potentially make a profit that dwarfs their listed price if used in a clever enough manner over a long timespan.<br /><br />The Potion of Longevity are here for medical reasons which should be fairly clear.<br /><br />Daern's Instant Fortress potentially has a huge impact on grand military strategy.</p></td></tr></tbody></table><h2>By Price

Once all levels of the tower have been explored, the players may challenge the final boss, the Arch Lich Diamunda, in her private sanctum.</p></li><li><p>After Level 1, the players arrive in each room on the yellow teleportation circle, and leave each room via the red teleportation circle. Each room has different challenges and criteria to either get to the exit teleportation circle, or to find a way to activate it through solving a puzzle, traversing the room, or killing monsters and finding the key.</p></li><li><p>As always, the details included in this adventure are <em>suggested guidelines</em>, and not a requirement. Running exactly as described here will be a balanced experience, but be willing to be flexible and reward player creativity and critical thinking and diverge from the expectations and success criteria described here. At level 18, the players have access to so many powerful spells and abilities that you can't possibly predict what they can do. Most skill checks will need to be quite high (18-23 or so) since players like bards and rogues often have +15 or more to their best abilities.</p></li><li><p>Through this document, there is various artwork.

Now and then, it seems to be drawn into the spire's peak. They talk over the fire, and begin their plan for the morning. They reminisce about why they are here…</em></p><h2>Backstory:</h2><p><em>The players are a group of famous, powerful adventurers. They had a 5th member of the party, a barbarian/fighter known as <strong>Chud</strong>, who some time ago came across a strange, greenish glowing lantern. He was secretive about it, avoiding anyone touch it or see it. It seemed to flare green when you fought monsters, especially when Chud killed things. <br /><br />Everything came to a head when, one morning, the party came into Chud's room and found him comatose. On the floor was his lantern, cracked down the center and faintly glowing, while his battleaxe lay smoking in the corner of the room. No magical intervention or healing has had any effect; it seems as if his soul has been stolen, even though his body is still alive.<br /><br />After much research, the party determined that the lantern is some strange arcane tool, and it is connected to the <strong>Blackstone Obelisk</strong>. This distant magic tower is a puzzling object, deep in the wastelands and far from any civilization. All expeditions and attempts to investigate it have resulted in death and failure, so interest has faded over the centuries, with people choosing to just avoid it. Determined to save Chud however, the team has come here to investigate it. The only rumors they have about the tower's origin is that a powerful lich may live there.</em></p><hr /><p>What the players DON'T know is that the lantern currently holds the soul of Chud, and the lantern serves as a receptacle for souls that are siphoned away from dying creatures and sent to this tower remotely. Chud was using it to sell souls in exchange for magic items gifted back to him through the lantern, but he eventually had a change of heart and tried to destroy it. Chud damaged the lantern, ruining its remote connection and magic item store abilities, but was sucked into the lantern as a result. The lantern is an important item for the tower, as the various walkthroughs for other levels will discuss.</p><hr /><p>Have the players share items, talk about their ideas, get used to the Foundry interface and using their character sheets, and make sure one of them has @UUID[Item.f30wmyxCOyMoIwux]{The Cracked Lantern}.</p><img src=\"modules/blackstone-obelisk-5e/Library/Artwork/Blackstone_Obelisk_Sillouette.png\" />","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":300000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"name":"Level 4: Topsy Turvy","type":"text","_id":"EVH3pjoW3PbOrcBs","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;color:#191813\"><em>As you stand upon the circle, you see four columns in the center of this circular room, with simple lights illuminating an array of long, horrible spikes arranged across the center of the room. On the ceiling, you see a different arrangement of spikes, different from the floor. Dozens of dimly glowing pools of green acid are on the ceiling, and now and then they drip little globs that fall the 40 feet down to land on the floor around the perimeter with a sizzle. The room is silent and motionless…</em></p><h2>The Challenge:</h2><p>The room does nothing until a player leaves the area of the entrance portal, at which point the room activates and players enter initiative.</p><p>In this room filled with spikes and traps on the floor and ceiling, gravity changes each round on initiative count 20 (every six seconds). To determine how it changes, flip a coin: [[/r 1d2]]</p><p>On a <strong>1</strong>, the gravity intensifies (regardless of gravity orientation), requiring a STR Saving Throw (DC 12 or 15, depending on how well the players are doing) to avoid being crushed to the floor and taking [[/r 2d6 # bludgeoning damage]] bludgeoning damage and stopping all movement for the round, and no damage and halving movement speed on a save. This intense gravity is important for the position of the players; if they are standing over spikes, in a pool of acid, or trying to climb across the room on a rope, this can all affect how they progress.</p><p>On a <strong>2</strong>, make a DEX Saving Throw to land safely as the gravity inverts (returning to normal gravity strength) and you fall onto the ceiling/floor. The DM should click the \"Toggle Switch for Gravity Reversal\" button on the top right of the map, and the scene will switch between the ceiling and floor maps. Failing to land well deals [[/r 4d6 # bludgeoning damage]] bludgeoning, and landing on spikes deals and additional [[/r 4d6 # piercing damage]] piercing damage, and are difficult terrain to walk through. When you flip the terrain, use the tile activation toggle to switch it to the ceiling image.</p><p>I the players fail the STR saving throw while they are walking through spikes, they fall onto the spikes and take [[/r 4d6 # piercing damage]].</p><p>Around the perimeter of the room on the floor are hidden fireball traps ([[/r 8d6 # fire damage]] fire damage, DC 15 DEX Save) to prevent players from walking around the side easily. These are invisible until triggered, and they reset to explode again after 2 rounds. If a player moves their token across one, the tile will reveal itself, and you can make them roll for the save.</p><p>Around the perimeter of the room on the ceiling are pools of acid ([[/r 6d6 # acid damage]] acid damage if contacted) to prevent players from walking around the side easily when gravity is flipped. When they are on the ceiling, small drips of acid fall to the floor below. If players fall into the acid or touch it, they automatically take the damage.</p><h2>The Solution:</h2><p>The fastest path out of the room is through the center, going to the exit portal on the other side, which is active and will provide a safe zone from the effects of the room once within its radius. Players can wait there for everyone to arrive, and help to speed up the process. Pulling a lever on the exit teleports everyone on the platform to the next level. Players will navigate this space however it seems best, using magic, items, spells, and more.</p><hr /><p>The spell Dimension Door trivializes this challenge, but it will still require casting two 4th level slots to escape its worst effects.

If the players attempt to barter for their friend's soul, she refuses any offers, stating that they are in no place to negotiate, and offering them a lifetime of servitude, collecting souls for her in exchange for wealth and power while they live.
